This project successfully demonstrates the application of Genetic Algorithms
to the feature selection problem in machine learning. The implementation
combines theoretical soundness with practical usability through a modern web
interface.

Key Contributions:
1. Robust GA implementation with proper evolutionary operators
2. Fair comparison framework against established statistical methods
3. User-friendly web application for non-technical users
4. Visualization tools for result interpretation
5. Production-ready code with proper documentation

Future Enhancement Opportunities:
- Multi-objective optimization (accuracy vs feature count trade-off)
- Advanced crossover operators (uniform, two-point)
- Adaptive mutation rates
- Parallel population evaluation
- Real-time progress streaming
- Persistent result storage
- Support for regression problems
- Ensemble feature selection
- Feature importance ranking visualization

Educational Value:
This project provides hands-on experience with evolutionary computation,
machine learning pipelines, web development, and comparative analysis—
essential skills for modern data science practitioners.
